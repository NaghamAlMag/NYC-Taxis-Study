# NYC Taxis Study
![Taxi](https://github.com/Edoardoba/Homework02/blob/master/taxis.png)


Before starting our analysis, we deeply studied the [legend](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf) and the [taxi_information pdf](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/taxi_information.pdf) to better understand our dataset. For every analysis we have done we explicitly mention the information, provided in both of the files, concerning with our results. We had to deal with a really large amount of data so we decided to split the tasks and create different jupyter's notebook files to make our evaluation simplier and clearier. But let's drive deep into it. Here is how our homework is divided:

1) **Code_before_starting**: This is all the code that covers the first section of the homework. We explain the choices we have made and the reason why we have chosen some methods instead  of others. 
2) **RQ1-2-3-4-5**: These .ipynb files contain all the code relative to the research questions with comments
3) **Final_core.ipynb**: All the code related to the first core question. T.student and p values are discussed in here. 
4) **Finalmap**: All the code related to the second core question. Choropleth map and comments about it.



And different images( We think no description is needed for those :P)
